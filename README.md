OpenGL Fighter Jet Shooting Game — C++ / GLUT
Technologies: C++, OpenGL, GLUT
Type: Desktop Graphics Game Project
Developed a 2D fighter jet shooting game using C++ and OpenGL (GLUT) with real-time rendering and keyboard controls.
Designed player and enemy jet systems with structured data models using C++ structs and vectors.
Implemented real-time game mechanics including:
Player movement and shooting controls
Enemy spawning with randomized movement patterns
Bullet physics and collision detection
Enemy AI shooting behavior
Built a level progression system that increases enemy count and speed dynamically.
Added score tracking, lives system, and game-over/restart logic.
Created on-screen UI elements such as instructions, score, level, and lives display using bitmap text rendering.
Implemented timer-based game loop updates at 60 FPS using GLUT timers.
Applied boundary checking and object lifecycle management for bullets and enemies.
Designed modular rendering functions for jets, bullets, enemies, and text display.
